Description:

As a solution I submitted the predictions for the classification of the ages. In order to the the classification my teammates and I decided to implement a pipeline consisting of data imputation, outlier detection, feature selection and regression. For data imputation we used SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute using as strategy the median. We decided then to preoceed to the removal of the samples of the training set containing values outside the range of the test set. We then sorted the columns of the training set using spareman correlation. We then trained lasso CV on 10 folds and did predicition on the outliers previously removed from the training set, in order to understand which were really outliers or not. We decided to remove from the original training set only the samples whose prediction had an absolute error greater than 20 years. On the preprocessed data we applied recursive feature elimination (RFE) from sklearn.feature_selection using as estimator GradientBoostingRegressor from sklearn.ensemble and selecting the 150 most significant features. We implemented then 15 regressors GradientBoostingRegressor using 500 as number of estimators for all of them. We used different random states fro each of the GradientBoostingRegressor regressors. 5 regressors had then as loss functions ls and 5. as loss function humble. We then proceeded with the averaging of the results obtained from the fitting and prediction.
