I submitted the predictions for the classification problem. In order to perform the the classification my teammates and I decided to implement a pipeline consisting of a classification method based on NNs developed using the Keras package. Firstly, my teammates and I normalized the data using the StandardScaler normalization. We then decided to build 3 models of neural networks. The first model of neural network is a 1 hidden layer NN with density=100, activation=relu and dropout=0.5. The second model is a 2 hidden layer NN with density=40, activation=relu and dropout=0.5 for both hidden layers. The third model is a 3 hidden layer NN with density=200, activation=relu and dropout=0.5 for both hidden layers. All NNs have output layer has desnity=3 and activation=softmax. All NN models use as loss=categorical_crossentropy, optimizer=adam and as metrics=accuracy. The fit for every model of NN is made with 100 epochs and 128 as batch size. The EarlyStopping callback function is used monitoring the validation loss on a split of 30% of the data and weigthing on the classes is used. The weigthing of the classes is based on the inverse of the number of occurrences of a  class with respect to the overall samples of the data set. To choose the best predictions for the solution of the task we then decided to use each of the models of NNs 5 times to fit and predict and compute the class probability predictions and sum them up. We then selected the predictions with higher probability.
